\section{How to Give a Talk}

\begin{frame}{Tell a story}

\bit
\item what's the problem?
\item preview your result
\item what solutions have others tried?
\item how does your idea work? and how is it different from previous work?
\item gory details / theory / how it works
\item applications / experiments / numerical evidence
\item now what?
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inspiration for this meta-talk: Heilmeier Catechism}

Heilmeier (DARPA director in 1950's) taught that grant proposals should include:
\bit
\item What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
\item How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
\item What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
\item Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
\item What are the risks? How much will it cost? How long will it take?
\item What are the mid-term and final ``exams'' to check for success?
\eit
for a talk, switch all these to the past tense

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What's the problem?}

kinds of problem
\bit
\item a real problem (whose?)
\item an ``open'' problem (why does it matter?)
\eit

pro tips:
\bit
\item you'd better ``solve'' the problem by the end of the talk\ldots
\item pictures help grab attention
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preview your result}

state your contribution
\bit
\item so audience understands what you did (and now can decide to pay attention or not)
\item maybe a theorem, maybe a picture, maybe a sentence or two
\item might require introducing some key definitions
\eit

pro tips:
\bit
\item leave caveats for later (but mention now if they're major or minor caveats)
\item no one will listen any more if this part is confusing
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What solutions have others tried?}

why compare to related work?
\bit
\item shows audience how hard the problem is
\item helps audience understand what you did (and what you didn't do)
\item keeps your colleagues feeling collegial
\eit

pro tips:
\bit
\item cite all authors by name if $\leq 3$ authors
\item maybe:
\bit
\item use your initial instead of name (eg, Kallus and U 2018)
\item bold your name (eg, Kallus and \textbf{Udell} 2018)
\eit
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How does your idea work?}

\bit
\item this section is usually longest
\item divide into subsections to explain parts of your approach
\item by the end, the audience should understand \emph{why} your idea works
\item use \emph{as little} technical machinery as possible to make that happen
\item provide intuition
\eit

pro tips:
\bit
\item provide quick high level overview \emph{and} details
\item so non-experts \emph{and} experts understand how it works
\item imagine the first year PhD student in the audience
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Gory details}

\bit
\item now you can impress people and lose them
\item make it clear you have technical chops
\item make the experts think you're smart
\item but none of this matters
\item because the audience already understands the important ideas
\eit

pro tips:
\bit
\item omit this part from a public talk
\item possibly also omit from a colloquium
\item definitely include in a job talk
\item probably include for this class, to build endurance
\item you can skip this if your talk is running over
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Experiments}

\bit
\item prove that your ideas work
\item show that they yield a useful solution
\item and that they actually solve the problem
\eit

pro tips:
\bit
\item ask for people to restore their attention (after gory details)
\item make experiment slides self-contained
\bit
\item state experimental settings, label axes and curves clearly, \ldots
\eit
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Know your audience}

\bit
\item imagine your audience
\bit
\item what do they know already? what will they find surprising?
\item often helps to imagine writing the talk for \emph{one particular person} who you know well
\item while giving the talk, look at the person whose face is giving feedback
\item (while listening to a talk, \emph{be} the person giving feedback)
\eit

\item it's ok to lose (some of) your audience
\bit
\item but you should plan for \emph{who} you'll lose and \emph{when} you'll lose them
\item generally, everyone should understand everything except for the ``gory details''
\item afterwards, tell people when to start paying attention again
\eit

\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concluding}

\bit
\item state conclusions
\item state research directions
\item provide references
\item ask for questions
\eit

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Style}

technology
\bit
\item \LaTeX / beamer presentations are common in Optimization
\item powerpoint / keynote are more common in other parts of Machine learning
\item google slides for collaborative development
\item theorists can make slides that contain only words, equations, and plots
\item systems presentations usually come with fancy pictures and animations
\eit

length
\bit
\item rule of thumb: one minute per slide
\item more if there are lots of pictures
\item less if there's lots of math to explain
\item have sections you can cut easily: gory details, applications
\item know at what time you should arrive at each section
\eit
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Style}

words
\bit
\item don't overwhelm the audience with reading
\item pick a convention and stick to it
\bit \item capitalization, punctuation, phrases vs sentences, etc \eit
\eit

equations
\bit
\item define your terms
\item use as few terms as possible
\item use words instead of symbols where possible
\eit
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Style}

animations
\bit
\item have semantic meaning
\eit

delivery
\bit
\item speak slowly and clearly
\item require the audience to ask questions
\item show that you're a human (humor, look at audience, ask questions, stop to think)
\item get ready for improvisation!
\eit

\end{frame}

\section{How to write a review}

\begin{frame}{Reviews}

\bit
\item summarize the paper in your own words
\item situate relative to related work
\item what's good
\item high level criticisms and major flaws
\item detailed line-by-line comments
\eit

\end{frame}

\section{Homework}

\begin{frame}{Homework}

\bit
\item register
\item sign up for slack
\item mark 3 papers you'd like to present on \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eSJn0_ANEXfOsZZrYwHoQ6F00FKBLz4olbKVtOLoE40/edit#gid=93392279}{paper selection google doc}
